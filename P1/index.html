            <div class="col pt-md-1 content">
              <p>For this project, we will be creating a website for the Arcadian Film Festival to celebrate a fusion of classical civilizations and contemporary cinema. This will serve as a hub for filmmakers, enthusiasts, and industry professionals to engage, share and explore multiple genres through the lens of film. </p>
              <p>The client’s primary goal is to have a website that filmmakers can use to submit/promote their films while also allowing film enthusiasts and industry professionals a way to experience these films. </p>
              <p>The scope of this project consists of the creation of a user-friendly website interface that is responsive across all devices, the creation of an extensive archive section featuring past festival events, film screenings, discussions and award winners and finally interactive features for film submission (along with information for film submission), award voting and community engagement to boost user participation and provide a unique and lasting user experience.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="col pt-md-1 content">
              <p>To start off the Toronto Film Festival has good SEO, running the website through SEO audits yields results of B. The website has excellent On-Page SEO allowing search engines to almost always make sure it’s the first website up when you type in keywords such as “film”, “film festival”, “Canada film festival”, “toronto film” and even “toronto festival”.</p>
              <p>The links are all functional with next to no dead links, the only way to improve them is to make them more human and Search Engine readable. </p>
              <p>However, a big issue is the total page file size. The page is very media heavy with videos playing in the background while also being filled with images which ends up meaning it runs a bit slower on dated machines and slower internet connections. Due to this when resizing the window the website takes a bit to resize the website content.</p>
              <p>The only glaring issue is the lack of an obvious call to action for Film Submission, this may be due to the fact that the festival is over and they are preparing for their 2024 festival; however, some information for future submissions and an easy way to access it would be very useful. To get to submissions I had to google tiff submissions due to the fact I couldn’t find it on the homepage so this is definitely something that needs to be improved.</p>
              <p>Overall, the website is great with a consistent theme and no inconsistencies with heading tags or typography. Everything has a good hierarchy and it is completely responsive so it works on all devices. </p>

            <div class="col pt-md-1 content">
              <p>We’ll be focusing on the films section of the website. The films section provides an interactive search filter that allows users to search for a title of a film, details about a film, or credits about a film. Users are able to click the buttons within the filter and the films will filter to its results.</p>
              <p>Of course, this isn’t the best filter system they’ve created. The filters provided are a mix of genres, film makers, and the type of film it is (e.g. short film, animation, episodic, etc). It makes it difficult to glance at the filter and pick out which one sounds the most interesting to us. The colors also clash with each other and make everything more overwhelming. </p>
              <p>The way the films are organized on that page is very pleasant. With a portrait image as the movie poster for each film, it makes it more engaging to the page and provides the more authentic feeling of movies and films. However, the movie text on top of the image creates a distraction that takes away attention from the movie poster.</p>

            <h4>Functional Testing</h4>
            <p>For testing we can conduct tests of all the website's functionalities to ensure that navigation, film listings, event listings, ticket purchasing and submission forms are all up to date and there are no broken links present.</p>
            <p>We will also test responsiveness across various devices and browsers to ensure compatibility and consistency.</p>
            <h4>Usability Testing</h4>
            <p>Gather feedback from a group of users through usability testing sessions or surveys. Using the feedback we can then identify pain points, usability issues and areas for improvement.</p>
            <h4>Content Review</h4>
            <p>Reviewing all the website content to make sure it’s relevant, accurate and consistent. Ensuring the content is well-written, free of grammatical errors and is aligned with the Arcadian theme and our website objectives.</p>
            <h4>Performance Testings</h4>
            <p>Measure website loading times and other performance metrics using <a href="https://pagespeed.web.dev/">Google PageSpeed Insights</a>.</p>
            <h4>Security Testing</h4>
            <p>Conducting security audits and vulnerability scans to identify potential security threats.
              Implementing things such as SSL encryption and other security methods to protect against SQL injections and cross-site scripting.
              </p>
            <p>Ensuring regular software, plugin and framework updates to patch security vulnerabilities that may arise.</p>

            <h4>Interview Questions</h4>
            <h5>Objective and Goals</h5>
            <ul class="list-group">
              <li>What specific goals or actions (e.g. film submissions, contact, etc.)do you want users to achieve with the website? (e.g., promoting the festival, selling tickets, providing information, user journey etc.)</li>
              <div class="answer">
                <p>In order of importance:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Allow short film fans to consume/enjoy the film makers’ creations online. We have an active and well informed community of film lovers who want to indulge in and share their passion for this art form</li>
                  <li>Allow film creators to submit their submissions online</li>
                  <li>Promote our annual festival; held in a theatre venue and we like to see good turnouts (free to attend)</li>
                </ol>
                <p>So: engage as much of a knowledgeable audience as possible (we need to build our reputation as a high calibre festival for these short film genres), and that audience volume & quality will in turn make the festival attractive to film creators (and help us recruit their submissions)</p>
              </div>
              <li>Are there any marketing/promotional tools you would like to integrate into the website? (e.g., email newsletter, sign-ups, promotional pop-up)</li>
              <div class="answer">
                <ul>
                  <li>We’ve been using MailChimp for our emails – is that something we can take advantage of? Also we have an active/interesting Instagram account</li>
                  <li><strong>Expected audience goals, like how many people do you think the website can handle?</strong> We estimate our local audience to be ~50 filmmakers and 300 festival attendees. Then there would be an external audience (North American? World-wide?) but that’s difficult for us to estimate</li>
                </ul>
              </div>
              <li>What kind of key information do you want to see when a film is clicked? (e.g. Directors, actors, tools used, etc.)</li>
              <p class="answer">Definitely info to credit/acknowledge the creators/crew as that is an important incentive for receiving submissions. Anything else that would make the audience click though to watch the film would be great.</p>
              <li>Are there any difficulties your user experience or audience faces when navigating through the site?</li>
              <p class="answer">This is our inaugural festival website</p>
            </ul>
            <h5>Target Audience</h5>
            <ul>
              <li>Who is your target audience for the film festival? (e.g., age group, interests, demographics)</li>
              <div class="answer">
                <ul>
                  <li>Here’s what we’ve been seeing as far as our theatre venue turnouts (about 150-200 attendees in each of the past 3 years):</li>
                  <p>[instructor note: taylor the audience that will realistically be drawn to your chosen genres]</p>
                  <li>Online: we don’t have that data, unfortunately. </li>
                </ul>
              </div>
              <li>Will the website need to support multiple languages?</li>
              <p class="answer">Languages other than English are not needed (unless there is a good case for it based on some genres or for recruiting global audiences?)</p>
            </ul>
            <h5>Media Requirements</h5>
            <ul>
              <li>What are the film submission criteria?</li>
              <div class="answer">
                <ol>
                  <li>Guardian consent if minors submitting</li>
                  <li>Up to two submissions per creator per year</li>

                  <li>Digital submission -specific requirements as far as info needed for database cataloguing and viewer interest [instructor note: please fill in here]</li>
                </ol>
              </div>
              <li>Should submissions only include local films or should they include films from other regions?</li>
              <p class="answer">Local films, but perhaps we could create a special category for outside the region? Up to you designers.</p>
              <li>What are the parameters of media formats that are allowed for file submission?</li>
              <p class="answer">The films themselves  will have to be hosted on a 3rd party website: youtube and/or vimeo will work. Our website will catalogue them and provide a way to view these (via a link or embedded video – up to you)</p>
            </ul>
            <h5>Design Styles</h5>
            <ul>

                  <li>Upload films</li>
                  <li>Get engaged with our festival – look forward to future years’ events; drum up anticipation</li>
                </ol>
              </div>
              <li>Are there any accessibility considerations or requirements?</li>
              <p class="answer">Not that we can think of.</p>
              <li>Is the event an online experience or an in-person event?</li>
              <p class="answer">Both (as per our client statement)</p>
              <li>Is there a specific branding you already have, looking for, or do you want us to establish one?</li>

              <p class="answer">Nothing comes to mind at the moment. Maybe not have it look too much like other festival’s website, so that the identity doesn’t get confused through similar branding?</p>
            </ul>
            <h5>Inspiration and References</h5>
            <ul>
              <li>Are there any specific design preferences or themes you have in mind for the website?</li>
              <div class="answer">
                <ul>
                  <li>design preferences : No, and it’s up to you to decide what’s best</li>
                  <li>Themes: we’d like you to refine it, narrow it down, but the grand theme is that our festival audience has deep understanding and interesting discussions surrounding short film-making – our festival activities reflect that and so should our website.</li>
